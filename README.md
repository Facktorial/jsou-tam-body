# Jsou tam body?

You know that feeling, when you are fresh wannabe orienteering runner and you're eager to hunt down ranking points, to prove yourself whatever?

Yeah.

Now u don't have to spend long hours to manually scrapping and calculating *Points base* coeficient to know, if potential ranking point gain is worth it. (_"Yeah, Ostrava is basically Dagobah-but points? They are real, I can see now. Thanks **[Jsou tam body?](https://facktorial.github.io/jsou-tam-body/)**!"_)

Some might use this tool to choose right class to attempt. _"This class? No competitionâ€”no points. The other one? A bloodbath for scraps... hmmm.... Thank you **[Jsou tam body?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT3mCybbhf0&list=RDoT3mCybbhf0&start_radio=1)**!"_)

Also, if u already failed your attempt, and you can predict mid-winner-time. U don't have to wait to results are published-you can be disappointed immediately... get crushed by reality in real-time, no waiting.

During pre-race prep, u can spend days sleepless nights haunted by fact knowledge of how many points you will lose for every damned second lost to a mistake.

Another inspiration for this project is overview of Base points distributions across different rankings, which are now tested and runs in experimental mode. (as of June 2025)

## Architecture
* In Czech are orienteering competitions registered on the ORIS portal. 
* This project, via webapp GUI, requests data scraping via the [ORIS API](https://oris.orientacnisporty.cz/API).
* Server sends response via endpoint in JSON. Meanwhile, dockerized Haskell server is hosted at [Railway](https://railway.com/).
* Results are visualized in interactive React.js single page app, which is deployed to GitHub Pages.
